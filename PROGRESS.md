## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start dev server (MUST use port 3009)
PORT=3009 npm run dev

# Reset database (wipes all data, re-creates schema)
rm prisma/dev.db && npx prisma db push && npx tsx prisma/seed.ts

# Build check (run before committing)
npm run build

# Open Prisma Studio (visual DB browser)
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db" npx prisma studio
```

## What To Work On Next

**Immediate priority (in order):**

1. **Wire up create forms** so Pratham can add campaigns/creators/clients via the UI
   - Start with: Campaign create modal (`components/CampaignModal.tsx`)
   - Then: Creator add form
   - Then: Client add form

2. **Campaign detail page** — make the tabs functional
   - Add creator to campaign (activation)
   - Show post deliverables

3. **Choose + configure production database**
   - Recommended: Neon (free, serverless PostgreSQL)
   - Steps: sign up → copy DATABASE_URL → `prisma db push` → seed

4. **Import real data** once DB is set up
   - Build import scripts or use the UI forms once they exist
